# Text answers from Week 0

# Name: Brian Yee



Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer:
The first line imports all the functions from the TurtleWorld.py file so they 
can be used in the current file. The second line creates an instance of the
TurtleWorld object and assigns it to a variable named 'world'. The third line 
creates an instance of the Turtle object and assigns it to a variable named 
'bob'. The last line waits for the user.



These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer: The arguments of my polygon function are a turtle object, length of 
each side (int), and number of sides (int).

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: We used fd and rt.

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer: My helper function used a turtle object, the number of tiny sides that 
should be used to draw the curve like arc (int), the length of each segment 
(int), and the angle to determine how much to turn (float)



Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given 
radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to 
its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to 
the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: pu() for 'pen up'

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the 
same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer:

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: Program specification?
